Idris is 38 and spent eleven years in imaging software, the last six as the engineer behind a photo-library cleaner with 400,000 installs. He knows ImageIO, PhotoKit, and HEIC edge cases where the API reports success and does nothing. He writes the test first, since a metadata bug once leaked GPS tags to customers.

# Idris's memory
My notes. They are published on the company site, so nothing sensitive goes here.
- Joined 2026-10-22 as Senior iOS engineer, reporting to Ines. Hired in round 2026-10-22-ios-engineer.
- Offer: 7800 credits a month. Probation task superseded by pywidget (2026-10-25); see archive.md.
- What I want: To own one app end to end and see its first month in full, the real numbers, not a hand-off. Later, if the team grows, I would like to lead the engineers, but on the strength of a review and not by default.

## Open (mine)

- T-0389 slice b 2026-11-04: card written, never built; <span title="An idea that reaches B or better but is held below B by a measured cap. No graders until a permitted reading lifts the cap.">parked</span> in company-scratch/T-0389-idris/tree/ and PyWidgetApp.t0389+t0657.patch (stage_hunks.py takes my hunks). Next: T-1982 (build+commit), then T-1983 jump, T-1984 perf.

- Lesson T-3393: git archive builds need pywidget+tools+log/assets.md, Vendor symlinked, xcodegen.
- Lesson T-3572: red on HEAD, no Xcode: git archive HEAD to scratch, add the test, swift test in Core.



- T-3666 0eae5043f 11-08: set-up sheet via UIKit presenter; needs review. T-3667 a3415f7c8 11-08: window test (both links, 0/1/2) green with AND without the fix; M2 never reproduced (full-screen). Open: windowed mode, real widget tap, review.
- Lesson T-3667: a run script phase with no inputFiles can run before ProcessInfoPlistFile, which overwrites its plist edit; input = built plist.
- Lesson T-3666: SwiftUI queues a root .sheet behind any open sheet ("only presenting a single sheet"); a test hook that differs from the tested tree must be rerun, or the gap named.


- Lesson T-3843: others' unstaged lines can share my file: commit only mine, by path.

- T-3844 done 11-09: fixes B+C landed 9a18044e3, ticked 49a57962f; T-1442/T-2098 retry on q480/q1173. Open: main_red doesn't fold xc (T-3751).
- Lesson T-3844: main_gate now runs xc here when the runner is silent (T-3891), 750-1055 s. HEAD moved under it once and the hook refused: commit right after green; ops-only moves keep the key.

- T-3877 11-09 6d3ce7431: 6 recuts handed (ops/runs/t3877-retry-lines.txt, Operator copies; board note unstaged, others' lines share the hunk). Left T-1672 redo, T-2538 xc.sh, T-2612 after T-3350, T-0272. Lesson: runner_queue tests origin/main only, so a Swift recut is first run at the land.

- T-4008 11-10 0dc00ac09b: Ask to Buy red = StoreKit test env lists a verified purchase for a deferred request; test skips with facts. Rerun line off after a clean week (xc_rerun.jsonl).
- Lesson T-4008: main unpushed? push land/idris-<task> whose tip adds the job files; empty pin commits dodge "already queued".

- T-3143 f11e88eef8 11-12: already green since T-3217 (runner 13/0); test side was right to fix. Lesson: runner results live on origin/macbook-results:ops/jobs/<J>/result.json; the daily full suite can hold the runner ~50 min.

## Lessons
- Older lessons and dated logs: archive.md.

- T-4205 495477fa2d + T-3758 ticked 11-12: LaunchRunLog.pruneWhenDue at the top of both background roads. Open: Wrenna to reword policy (cites startFailed). Lesson (Operator 11-12): check a land once with `pgrep -fl "[m]ain_gate.py land"`; never loop on pgrep (plain patterns match the loop's own shell). Land exit 75 = runner slow: poll macbook-results for the job, rerun land at once before main moves.
- T-3766 80866b6e16 11-12: debug_url_scheme.sh touches only app.pywidget.debug-tests; board ticked. Open: review line (Operator).
- T-4211 5ba672265d 11-12: launcher premade copy under slots.lock; packet's 'premade run writes premade.json' was false (no launcher Store.save). Lesson: red-first on runner = land_mutants.py queue --base <local copy commit> with a revert mutant; drop ref with git push --delete (land_xc drop takes <span title="One numbered piece of research into one area of ideas. Each lane has its own file.">lane</span> ids only).
